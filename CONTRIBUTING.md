# Contributing to x-stable-diffusion

Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution. Code
is thus not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping
others, reaching out and improving the documentations are immensely valuable to
the community.

It also helps us if you spread the word: through blog posts, shout out on Twitter, or simply starring the repo to say "thank you".

Whichever way you choose to contribute, please be mindful to respect our
[code of conduct](https://github.com/stochasticai/x-stable-diffusion/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to contribute

* Fixing outstanding issues
